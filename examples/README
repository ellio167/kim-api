This directory (examples) contains directories with example Model Drivers,
Portable Models, Simulator Models, and Simulators.  Please see the README files
within each directory for information about the examples.

Items in these directories may be built as part of the main KIM API build.  Or,
they may be build separately, after the KIM API has been built and installed.
In the latter case, for Portable Models and Model Drivers, use the
kim-api-collections-management utility to build and install the items.  For the
simulators, the following example sequence of commands is typical.

$ cd simulators/ex_test_Ar_fcc_cluster
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ../ -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
$ make
